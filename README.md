<strong>[DataMagic](https://datamagic.ai/)</strong> is an Agentic Knowledge Platform connecting your company's docs, data, code, and people. 
DataMagic provides a Chat interface for the members of your data teams to learn more about your data stack on-demand. DataMagic can be deployed anywhere and for any 
scale - on a laptop, on-premise, or to cloud. Since you own the deployment, your user data and chats are fully in your 
own control.

DataMagic also serves as a Unified Search across all common workplace tools such as Slack, Google Drive, Confluence, etc.
By combining LLMs and team specific knowledge, DataMagic becomes a subject matter expert for the team. 
Data Magic also brings Agentic workflows to automate activities like new member onboarding and offboarding, data artefact owner mapping, ambiguity resolution, etc.
It answers questions like "Why is schema ABC architected this way?" or "Has task XYZ been done in the past?".
It also performs task like "Create a 1 week training program from to onboard a data engineer for team A who will work on projects M."
